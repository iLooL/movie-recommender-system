## About This Project

This was an end of term group project for a senior level [data mining course](https://academic-calendar.wlu.ca/course.php?c=50474&cal=1&d=1903&s=897&y=77). To complete this task we first implemented a standard kNN collaborative model to get a good foundation of knowledge of recommender systems. We then wanted to expand and improve upon this so we used a latent vector based model. You can find a thorough explaination of each approach in the PDF above. This project uses the small education & development [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).
